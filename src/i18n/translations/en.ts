          question: "How does the free plan work?",
          answer: "In the free plan you can create 1 AI agent and send up to 30 messages per month. You can train your AI, use the simulator and test all features. To connect with WhatsApp and send more messages, you need to upgrade to a paid plan."

        q2: {
          question: "Do I need to know how to program to use it?",

        },
        q3: {
          question: "How does the AI learn about my business?",
          answer: "You can train your AI in 3 ways: uploading PDF files (like catalogs, manuals), typing frequent questions and answers, or pasting free texts about your business. The more information, the better it responds."
        },

          question: "Does it work with WhatsApp Business?",

        },
        q6: {
          question: "How many customers can the agent serve?",
